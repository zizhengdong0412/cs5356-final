## Idea  
For now, we're creating a "Social Recipe Binders"
A Next.js full-stack web app that allows users to sign up and sign in
Users can create Recipe Binders, which contain many Recipes.
Domain: Recipes have a list of tuples of ingredients and amounts (in domain-specific units). They also have an ordered list of steps.
Users can share individual recipes or entire Recipe Binders with other users.
