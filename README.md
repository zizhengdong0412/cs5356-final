Prototypes: # Any photos of prototypes you built or sketches you used to align your team's plans
Starter Code: # If you used any starter code repositories, list which you used
Technology Choices: # List any major dependency you used (e.g. "React" or "Better Auth")
(if it wasn't covered in class, let us know why you chose it!)
Learnings: # Did anything during the final project come up that was unexpectedly harder (or easier) than you expected?
